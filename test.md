# **1. Getting Started**
If you never coded before, programming can be hard. That's why we created this E-Book, to help new coders begin. For more expirience developers, you can chose to read this book or begin coding.

This book will have multiple chapters, sub-chapters and extra tips/tricks from the team who made Kookaburra. Let's code!
